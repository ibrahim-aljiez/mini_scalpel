# Mini-Scalpel: Simple File Carving Tool

## Overview

Mini-Scalpel is a Python-based file carving tool that allows users to search for patterns within TXT, CSV, JSON, and PDF files. It extracts matching content and saves them as separate output files. The tool also provides a menu-driven interface to carve files, view extracted content, or exit the program.

## Features

* Pattern search in TXT, CSV, JSON, and PDF files.
* Case-insensitive search.
* Recursive search for nested structures in JSON files.
* Page-wise search in PDF files.
* Saves carved matches in `carved_output/` directory.
* Menu-driven interface for easy operation.
* View carved documents from within the program.

## File Carving Functions

### `carve_txt(path, pattern)`

* Opens a TXT file.
* Returns a list of lines containing the specified pattern (case-insensitive).

### `carve_csv(path, pattern)`

* Opens a CSV file.
* Returns a list of rows (as strings) containing the pattern.

### `carve_json(path, pattern)`

* Reads and parses a JSON file.
* Recursively searches through nested dictionaries and lists.
* Returns a list of key-value pairs matching the pattern.

### `carve_pdf(path, pattern)`

* Opens a PDF in binary mode.
* Reads each page and extracts text.
* Returns a list of pages containing the pattern, including page numbers.

### `save_matches(matches)`

* Saves each match in a separate text file inside the `carved_output/` folder.

### `view_carved_docs()`

* Displays the content of all previously carved documents stored in the `carved_output/` folder.

## Notes

* All carved files are saved in the `carved_output/` folder.
* Pattern searches are **case-insensitive**.
* The program handles errors such as missing files or unsupported file types gracefully.
